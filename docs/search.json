To expand on this a little more, If there are two tasks that need doing with varying levels of urgency, it’s likely that too many individuals or two few individuals will get recruited to a specific task. Hence you get cycles of over- and under-shooting in terms of the number of ants performing a task relative to the optimum. This shall be my primary task\nThus, benefit of variation = a more “smooth” transitioning since some are more prone to respond to a specific signal.\nAre individuals more responsive overall to change, or more responsive in a one-way manner? Expanding, do ants specialise at switching tasks or specialise at performing specific tasks? If the latter, we expect ants that are recruited to a task early are also the ants that leave that task last. If the former, ants recruited early will also leave the task early (hence why the colony could undershoot).\nThe cue to perform a task is hypothesised to be sensory by Ina and Susanne. Specifically, ants might have different sensitivities to the cue, due to a varying number of sensory receptors in their antennae."
